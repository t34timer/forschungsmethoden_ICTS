\section{Summary}
\label{sec:summary}
We have described a method for connecting commits and issues by comparing their commit messages, titles and descriptions as well as by having a look at the meta information of issues and commits.
If the assignment of an issue to a commit is not possible, we propose a categorization of the issues and commits for supporting at least a less accurate mapping to categories.
We then implemented a prototype to test our theories by using real data from an academic software project and we came to the conclusion that our method generally works fine but only if we improve the quality of the commit messages.
In our original sample data the messages were too inaccurate and mainly because of this we were not able to link many commits to their related issue.\\
A possible approach in the future is to scientifically refine the method by studying several software projects to find the best balance within the rating parameters and for example by finding a way to be more tolerant with commit messages, which do not follow best practices.
One then can expand the prototype to a customizable software one can use for issue and commit logs, regardless of the original format and with adjustable rating parameters with the help of an interactive user interface.
