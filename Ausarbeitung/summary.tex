\section{Summary}
\label{sec:summary}
We have described a method for connecting commits and issues by comparing their commit messages, titles and descriptions as well as by having a look at the meta information of issues and commits.
If the assignment of an issue to a commit is not possible, we propose a categorization of the issues and commits for supporting at least a less accurate mapping to categories.
We then implemented a prototype to test our theories by using real data from an academic software project and we came to the conclusion that [TODO: 1-2 Saetze ueber implementation results].\\
A possible approach in the future is to scientifically refine the method and to expand the prototype to a customizable software one can use for issue and commit logs, regardless of the original format and with adjustable rating parameters with the help of an interactive user interface.
