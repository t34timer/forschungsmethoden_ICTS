\section{Aufgabe}
\subsection{Questions to be addressed}
How are requirements managed? (Processes, Tools)  Architecture
 Is architectural documentation available?\\
 Which architectural styles are used?\\
 Is it a product line architecture? (Variability)\\
 Have quantitative techniques been used for architecture
evaluation/optimization?\\
 How has the architecture evolved over the years?\\
 Have researchers analyzed these projects already? Which
techniques have been applied? Results?

\subsection{what is expected?}
Analyze requirements management and architecture of a large real-world software project \\
 Describe its development process and evolution \\
 Use appropriate methods, techniques, and tools to analyze and
document the architecture) \\
 A report that describes the process and the outcome of the
requirements and architecture analysis\\
 We will create an ILIAS group for the group members
