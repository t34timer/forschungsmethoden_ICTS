\section{Implementation results}
\label{sec:implementation_results}
To test the algorithm described in \nameref{sec:methods} we implemented a prototype for associating commits from a version control system and issues from an issue tracking system.
We used real data from an academic software project to test different variants of the mapping algorithm.
In this section we describe the results we achieve with the sample data with different variants of the algorithm.
