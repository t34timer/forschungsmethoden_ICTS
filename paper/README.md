About
=====

Unoffical LaTeX template for Master, Bachelor, Diploma, and Student Theses at the University of Stuttgart, Computer Science.

More information at https://github.com/latextemplates/uni-stuttgart-computer-science-template.

It originates from the studiforge server at https://vorlagen.studiforge.informatik.uni-stuttgart.de/trac/

Quick start
-----------
If you don't want to use git, just download https://github.com/latextemplates/uni-stuttgart-computer-science-template/archive/template.zip

Recommended LaTeX environments
------------------------------
* offline: Grammar and spell checking is available at [TeXstudio].
  Please download [LanguageTool] and [configure TeXstudio to use it](http://wiki.languagetool.org/checking-la-tex-with-languagetool#toc4).
  Note that it is enough to point to `languagetool.jar`.
  Use [JabRef] to manage your bibliography.
* online: [overleaf]. Also with [git support](https://www.overleaf.com/blog/195-new-collaborate-online-and-offline-with-overleaf-and-git-beta#.VYFC2UZejkU).

See [LaTeX Editors/IDEs question on TeX.SX](http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/339/latex-editors-ides) for a complete list of LaTeX editors.

### Recommended setup of MiKTeX
* Install MiKTeX for: "Only for: `username`"
* Install MiKTeX to: `C:\MiKTeX`. This enabled browsing for documentation at `C:\MiKTeX29\doc\latex
* Install missing packages on the fly: `Yes`

Characteristics of the template
-------------------------------
* UTF-8
* pdflatex
* [latexmk]
* [biblatex]+[biber] instead of plain [bibtex]

This template works on Windows using the current [MiKTeX](http://www.miktex.org) distribution.
On Linux (TexLive full >= 2013) should work without any issues.
Even though AuToLaTeX is [more powerful than latexmk](http://www.arakhne.org/autolatex/), it is [not included in MiKTeX](http://www.ctan.org/pkg/autolatex) and therefore it is not used here.


Using with your own git repository
==================================

Initialization
--------------
This howto assumes that you have not a git repository for your thesis.
If you have, just add https://github.com/latextemplates/uni-stuttgart-computer-science-template.git as upstream and merge the branch "template" into your "master" branch.

1. Open command line
1. Change to the directory where you want to have your main tex file.
1. Fetch the template from github: `git clone https://github.com/latextemplates/uni-stuttgart-computer-science-template.git .`
1. Rename `origin` to `github` to enable adding your own `origin` repository: `git remote rename origin github`
1. Create a new branch master starting from the latest commit in the `template` branch: `git checkout -b master`

Now, you are on the `master` branch, where you can write your thesis and push it to your (remote) `origin` repository, in case you have one.

Merging updates from the template
---------------------------------
If you want to merge updates from github, do the following:

1. git fetch github
1. git merge github/template


LaTeX compilation
=================
The template is compiled using normal LaTeX commands.
Your LaTeX environment (such as [TeXStudio]) should take care about the compilation transparently.
When the "Package Installation" dialog pops up at TeXStudio, choose your username at "The package will be installed for:" and uncheck "Always show this dialog before installing packages."
If you want to include .svg graphics, [inkscape] has to be in your path.

If you want to compile using the command line, you can use following tools.

Automatic compilation using latexmk
-----------------------------------

    latexmk ausarbeitung

Continuous previewing using latexmk
-----------------------------------

    latexmk -pvc ausarbeitung

This will open a [Sumatra PDF] and only works with the supplied configuration.

### latexmk configuration
This repository ships a `.latexmk` which is read by latexmk.
It is configured for Windows and especially sets Sumatra PDF as default PDF viewer.
You can make this local configuration a global configuration, when you put it at [the right place](http://tex.stackexchange.com/a/41149/9075).

If you want to add more packages, configure it there.
For instance, for support of makeglossaries see http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/1226/how-to-make-latexmk-use-makeglossaries.

Automatic compilation using make
--------------------------------
For those, who have [cygwin](http://www.cygwin.com/) installed or run a linux machine, this template offers a simple LaTeX makefile.
It is not so sophisticated as other projects, but does its job.

    make

Make targets:
 * `pdf` (default): Generates ausarbeitung.pdf
 * `aspell`: Checks all files using aspell.
 * `clean`: Removes all temporary files.
 * `mrproper`: Cleans up and removes also editor backup files.
 * `stand`: Creates a new PDF with the current status of the thesis.
 * `view`: Opens the configured viewer
 * `6`: Generates a 3x2 postscriptfile using psnup.

Tweaks
======

Switching to English
--------------------

The template has been built primarily for German documents. English documents, however, are also very welcome.

Five steps to switch to English typesetting:

1. `ausarbeitung.tex`: Add `%` before `\RequirePackage[ngerman=ngerman-x-latest]{hyphsubst}`
1. `ausarbeitung.tex`: Right on top: remove the `%` before `pointlessnumbers` (line 17)
1. `ausarbeitung.tex`: Exchange commands `\ifdeutsch` and `\ifenglisch`. (Lines 23,23 <-> 27,28).
1. `preambel/packages_and_options.tex` at `usepackage` of `uni-stuttgart-cs-cover`: disable `language=german` and enable `language=english`. (Lines 448 and 449)
1. Cleanup everything (e.g., `latexmk -c ausarbeitung`). Otherwise pdflatex will complain because of `ngerman`.

Change Appearance of Chapter Headings
-------------------------------------

Edit `preambel/chapterheads.tex`.

Final version
-------------

  - If you included some version control statements, please remove them. Currently, the template does not support any, but it used to support SVN.
  - By using `\largeparge` and `\shortpage`, single lines at the bottom or at the top of the page can be manually fixed.
  - Search the PDF for "TODO" or similar things. Remove `\usepackage{todonotes}` in `preambel/packages_and_options`.
  - Ensure that you run `pdflatex` at least three times and that there no "undefined references".
  - The margins are intended for a duplex printing. **Do not change them** (or do exactly know what you are doing).
